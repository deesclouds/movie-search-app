## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Doppler, MongoDB <br>
This application was made with sample movie data from Mongo Atlas. 


## Optimizations
Use Doppler to ensure that my secret file stays just thatâ€”secret.

# Issues
App is currently down until I host it on another platform. Gif displays functionality. 


## Lessons Learned:
A major lesson learned was keeping my secret files secret and making sure that was done.
